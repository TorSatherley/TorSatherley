## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tor.

Iâ€™m a Junior Data Engineer with a passion for building robust systems that transform raw data into actionable insights. My main skills are in Python, SQL, cloud platforms (AWS), and Test-Driven Development (TDD), which I've honed through the Northcoders Data Engineering Bootcamp. I thrive on solving complex problems and enjoy the continuous learning that comes with working in tech.

To see some of my work, check out my pinned repo ToteSys-ETL-pipeline. This was a project undertaken whilst studying Data Engineering with Northcoders, and was a collaborative effort between five of us. Check out the README in the repo for more information!

For a more condensed example of some of my solo functional programming and test driven development, check out my other pinned repo, password-manager.
