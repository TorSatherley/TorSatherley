## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Tor.
Iâ€™m an aspiring Junior Data Engineer with a passion for building robust systems that transform raw data into actionable insights. Currently, Iâ€™m honing my skills in Python, SQL, cloud platforms (AWS), and Test-Driven Development (TDD) through the Northcoders Data Engineering Bootcamp. I thrive on solving complex problems and enjoy the continuous learning that comes with working in tech.
